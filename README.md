This project demonstrates the use of a recyclerview layout containing a list of rows.
Users are able to freely move rows around, and highlight (or dehighlight) them based on selection.

Additionally, each row layout contains textviews which plays a role of a column. Checking the corresponding checkboxes,
below toggles these textviews visibility.
